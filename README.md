# Java-For-Beginners
If you are looking for a free way to **effectively** learn Java, then this repository is for you!
It covers the basic Java topics like:
  ```Java
// System printing
System.out.print("This is a ");
System.out.println("new line sentence");
// Data types
int n = 0;
boolean flag = false;
String s = "Hello, World!"
// In-line comments, like this line.
/*
This goes across many lines
See?
The computer will ignore this
*/
// Importing classes
import java.util.Scanner
// Naming objects
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
// Writing methods outside "main"
public static void test()
  {
    System.out.print("Success");
  }
```
And much more!
> This repo is not meant to *completely* substitute real curriculum-based learning and only scratches at the surface of Java.
